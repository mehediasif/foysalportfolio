            &quot;I attended Poznan University of Technology in Poland as a student of Electronics and Telecommunication for my Bachelor&apos;s degree. Although I was only able to complete the first semester due to personal reasons, the knowledge and experience I gained during that time have been invaluable. I have developed a strong foundation in electrical engineering concepts and gained exposure to the latest technology trends in the industry. While I was not able to complete my degree at Poznan University of Technology, the skills and knowledge I gained have been instrumental in shaping my career aspirations and professional development.&quot;
